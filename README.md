# CCKW_database
Database of Convectively Coupled Kelvin Waves (CCKWs) calculated from IMERG precipitation.

This repository contains a python pickle file with a database of CCKWs calculated according to the methodology in Matthews (2021). The CCKW database was calculated from IMERG V07B precipitation data, averaged from 2.5S-2.5N. Further details in Matthews (2021)

The time domain of the latest version of the database currently runs from 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2023.
